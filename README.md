This series of code is designed to explore the hyperuniform properties of leaf vein configurations. The code is divided into three parts: Image Processing, Statistical calculations, and Diffusion_spreadability.

# Image Processing
In the Image Processing section, *Obtain_configuration.py* is used to analyze images of leaf vein samples and form configurations based on the geometric centers of each cell. *Plot_configuration.py* is used to plot schematic diagrams of configurations for observation and subsequent processing. *Count_configuration_pixels.py* is used to count the pixel positions of the schematic diagrams of configurations, which is a prerequisite for calculating spreadability.

# Statistical calculations
In the Statistical calculations section, various statistical calculations such as pair correlation functions, number variance, and structure factor can be computed based on the configurations.

# Diffusion_spreadability
Finally, in the Diffusion_spreadability section, spreadability is calculated based on the statistical analysis of pixel positions to characterize the transport properties of configurations.
